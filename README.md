# ManageMyDog

This websites will display all medical records, breed history and training records of your dogs.Vets and specialist dog care will have the ability to review and update dog's medical records.

There is a option to update general information like weight, behavioural changes and latest Vet visits. This information can be then displayed in a summary section for the selected dog.

More information will follow as I get on with this litle project. This website will hopefully be changed from HTML,CSS,JS with no backend to a website Using React and Strapi.
